This is a readme file for the models associated with

Dougherty, Wright and Yew (2005) Computational model of the
cAMP-mediated sensory response and calcium-dependent 
adaptation in vertebrate olfactory receptor neurons. 
PNAS 2005 Jul 26;102(30):10415-20.

Example use of the model files:

1)download and expand the zip file.
2)Start matlab.
3)Within matlab, cd to the directory created when the zip 
  file was expanded (for example I expanded the zip file in
  c:/nrnmodels):
  >> cd c:/nrnmodels/dwy_pnas_demo2/
  or alternatively add that file to your matlab path.
4)Run the program by typing the name at the matlab prompt

>> dwy_pnas_demo2
5) select single and press ok a few times to create fig 1a,1b
from the paper.
